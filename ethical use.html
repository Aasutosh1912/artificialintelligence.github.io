            <h1>Ethical use of artificial intelligence</h1><br>
            <p>
                While AI tools present a range of new functionality for businesses, the use of artificial
                <br>intelligence also raises ethical questions because, for better or worse, an AI system will
                <br>reinforce what it has already learned.<br><br><br>

                This can be problematic because machine learning algorithms, which underpin many of the <br>most
                advanced AI tools, are only as smart as the data they are given in training. Because a <br>human being
                selects what data is used to train an AI program, the potential for machine<br> learning bias is
                inherent and must be monitored closely.<br><br><br>

                Anyone looking to use machine learning as part of real-world, in-production systems needs <br>to factor
                ethics into their AI training processes and strive to avoid bias. This is especially true<br> when using
                AI algorithms that are inherently unexplainable in deep learning and generative <br>adversarial network
                (GAN) applications.<br><br><br>

                Explainability is a potential stumbling block to using AI in industries that operate under strict
                <br>regulatory compliance requirements. For example, financial institutions in the United States<br>
                operate under regulations that require them to explain their credit-issuing decisions. When a
                <br>decision to refuse credit is made by AI programming, however, it can be difficult to explain <br>how
                the decision was arrived at because the AI tools used to make such decisions operate <br>by teasing out
                subtle correlations between thousands of variables. When the decision-making<br> process cannot be
                explained, the program may be referred to as black box AI.<br><br><br>
                Despite potential risks, there are currently few regulations governing the use of AI tools, and
                <br>where laws do exist, they typically pertain to AI indirectly. For example, as previously<br>
                mentioned, United States Fair Lending regulations require financial institutions to explain <br>credit
                decisions to potential customers. This limits the extent to which lenders can use deep <br>learning
                algorithms, which by their nature are opaque and lack explainability.<br><br><br>

                The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) puts strict limits on how<br> enterprises
                can use consumer data, which impedes the training and functionality of many<br> consumer-facing AI
                applications.<br><br><br>

                <img src="./use.webp" height="800px" width="800px"><br><br><br>

                In October 2016, the National Science and Technology Council issued a report examining<br> the potential
                role governmental regulation might play in AI development, but it did not<br> recommend specific
                legislation be considered.<br><br><br>

                Crafting laws to regulate AI will not be easy, in part because AI comprises a variety of
                <br>technologies that companies use for different ends, and partly because regulations can <br>come at
                the cost of AI progress and development. The rapid evolution of AI technologies is <br>another obstacle
                to forming meaningful regulation of AI. Technology breakthroughs and <br>novel applications can make
                existing laws instantly obsolete. For example, existing laws <br>regulating the privacy of conversations
                and recorded conversations do not cover the <br>challenge posed by voice assistants like Amazon's Alexa
                and Apple's Siri that gather but do<br> not distribute conversation -- except to the companies'
                technology teams which use it to <br>improve machine learning algorithms. And, of course, the laws that
                governments do manage <br>to craft to regulate AI don't stop criminals from using the technology with
                malicious intent.<br>
            <h1>Cognitive computing and AI</h1><br><br>
            <p>
                The terms AI and cognitive computing are sometimes used interchangeably, but, generally<br> speaking,
                the label AI is used in reference to machines that replace human intelligence by<br> simulating how we
                sense, learn, process and react to information in the environment.<br><br><br>

                The label cognitive computing is used in reference to products and <br>services that mimic and augment
                human thought processes.<br><br><br>
