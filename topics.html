            <h1>What are the 4 types of artificial intelligence?</h1><br>
            <p> Arend Hintze, an assistant professor of integrative biology and computer science and <br>engineering at
                Michigan State University, explained in a 2016 article that AI can be<br>
                categorized into four types, beginning with the task-specific intelligent systems in wide use <br>today
                and progressing to sentient systems, which do not yet exist. The categories are as<br>follows:<br><br>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-dot"></i> Type 1: Reactive machines.<br> <br>These AI systems have no
                memory and are task specific. <br>An example is
                Deep Blue, the IBM chess program that beat Garry Kasparov in the 1990s. <br>Deep Blue can identify
                pieces on the chessboard and make predictions, but because it<br> has no memory, it cannot use past
                experiences to inform future ones.<br><br><br>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-dot"></i> Type 2: Limited memory. <br><br>These AI systems have memory, so
                they can use past<br> experiences to inform
                future decisions. Some of the decision-making functions in <br>self-driving cars are designed this
                way.<br><br><br>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-dot"></i> Type 3: Theory of mind. <br><br>Theory of mind is a psychology
                term. When applied to AI, it<br> means that
                the system would have the social intelligence to understand emotions. <br>This type of AI will be able
                to infer human intentions and predict behavior, a necessary skill for <br>AI systems to become integral
                members of human teams.<br><br><br>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-dot"></i> Type 4: Self-awareness. <br><br>In this category, AI systems have
                a sense of self, which gives <br>them
                consciousness. Machines with self-awareness understand their own current state.<br> This type of AI does
                not yet exist.<br><br>

            <h1>What are examples of AI technology <br>and how is it used today?</h1><br>
            <p>AI is incorporated into a variety of different types of technology. Here are six examples:<br><br>

                <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-dot"></i> Automation.<br><br> When paired with AI technologies, automation
                tools can expand the volume <br>and types
                of tasks performed. An example is robotic process automation (RPA), a type of <br>software that
                automates repetitive, rules-based data processing tasks traditionally done<br> by humans. When combined
                with machine learning and emerging AI tools, RPA can<br> automate bigger portions of enterprise jobs,
                enabling RPA's tactical bots to pass along <br>intelligence from AI and respond to process
                changes.<br><br><br>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-dot"></i> Machine learning.<br><br> This is the science of getting a
                computer to act without programming. <br>Deep
                learning is a subset of machine learning that, in very simple terms, can be thought<br> of as the
                automation of predictive analytics. There are three types of machine learning <br>algorithms:<br><br>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Supervised learning.<br> <br>Data sets are labeled so that
                patterns can be detected and<br> used to label
                new data sets.<br><br><br>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Unsupervised learning.<br><br> Data sets aren't labeled and are
                sorted according to <br>similarities or
                differences.<br><br><br>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Reinforcement learning.<br> <br>Data sets aren't labeled but,
                after performing an action or <br>several
                actions, the AI system is given feedback.<br><br><br>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-dot"></i> Machine vision. <br><br>This technology gives a machine the
                ability to see. Machine vision<br> captures and
                analyzes visual information using a camera, analog-to-digital conversion <br>and digital signal
                processing.
                It is often compared to human eyesight, but machine vision <br>isn't bound by biology and can be
                programmed
                to see through walls, for example. It is <br>used in a range of applications from signature
                identification
                to medical image analysis. <br>Computer vision, which is focused on machine-based image processing, is
                often<br>
                conflated with machine vision.<br><br><br>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-dot"></i> Natural language processing (NLP).<br> <br>This is the processing
                of human language by a <br>computer
                program. One
                of the older and best-known examples of NLP is spam detection,<br> which looks at the subject line and
                text
                of an email and decides if it's junk. Current <br>approaches to NLP are based on machine learning. NLP
                tasks
                include text translation,<br> sentiment analysis and speech recognition.<br><br>
                <img src="./component.jpg" height="800px" width="800px"><br><br>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-dot"></i> Robotics.<br><br> This field of engineering focuses on the design
                and manufacturing of robots. <br>Robots
                are often
                used to perform <br>tasks that are difficult for humans to perform or perform consistently. For example,
                robots are used in assembly lines for car production or by <br>NASA to move large objects in space.
                Researchers are also using machine learning to <br>build robots that can interact in social
                settings.<br><br><br>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-dot"></i> Self-driving cars.<br><br> Autonomous vehicles use a combination
                of computer vision, image<br> recognition
                and deep
                learning to build automated skill at piloting a vehicle while staying in<br> a given lane and avoiding
                unexpected obstructions, such as pedestrians.<br><br><br>
