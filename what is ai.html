            <h1>What is artificial intelligence (AI)?</h1>
            <p> Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by <br>machines, especially
                computer
                systems. Specific applications of AI include expert <br>systems, natural language processing, speech
                recognition and machine vision.</p><br><br>
            <img src="./what.jpg" height="400px" width="800px" class="lol">

            <h1>How does AI work?</h1>
            <p>As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to promote how their <br>products and
                services use AI. Often what they refer to as AI is simply one component of AI,<br> such as machine
                learning.
                AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for <br>writing and training machine
                learning
                algorithms. No one programming language is<br> synonymous with AI, but a few, including Python, R and
                Java,
                are popular.<br>
                <br>
                In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training data, analyzing <br>the data
                for
                correlations and patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions about <br>future states. In this
                way, a
                chatbot that is fed examples of text chats can learn to produce <br>lifelike exchanges with people, or
                an
                image
                recognition tool can learn to identify and describe <br>objects in images by reviewing millions of
                examples.<br>
                <br>
                AI programming focuses on three cognitive skills: learning, reasoning and self-correction.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Learning processes.</b> This aspect of AI programming focuses on acquiring data and creating
                <br>rules
                for how to
                turn the data into actionable information. The rules, which are called <br>algorithms, provide computing
                devices
                with step-by-step instructions for how to complete a<br> specific task.<br><br>
                <b>Reasoning processes.</b>This aspect of AI
                programming focuses on choosing the right <br>algorithm to reach a desired outcome.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Self-correction processes.</b>This aspect of AI programming is designed to continually fine-tune
                <br>algorithms and
                ensure they provide the most accurate results possible.<br><br>
            </p><br>
            <h1>Why is artificial intelligence important?</h1>
            <p>AI is important because it can give enterprises insights into their operations that they may <br>not have
                been
                aware of previously and because, in some cases, AI can perform tasks better <br>than humans.
                Particularly
                when
                it comes to repetitive, detail-oriented tasks like analyzing<br> large numbers of legal documents to
                ensure
                relevant fields are filled in properly, AI tools <br>often complete jobs quickly and with relatively few
                errors.<br><br>
                <img src="./a.jpg" height="600px" width="800px">
                <br><br>
                This has helped fuel an explosion in efficiency and opened the door to entirely new business
                <br>opportunities
                for some larger enterprises. Prior to the current wave of AI, it would have been<br> hard to imagine
                using
                computer software to connect riders to taxis, but today Uber has<br> become one of the largest companies
                in
                the
                world by doing just that. It utilizes sophisticated <br>machine learning algorithms to predict when
                people
                are
                likely to need rides in certain areas,<br> which helps proactively get drivers on the road before
                they're
                needed. As another example,<br> Google has become one of the largest players for a range of online
                services
                by
                using<br> machine learning to understand how people use their services and then improving them. <br>In
                2017,
                the
                company's CEO, Sundar Pichai, pronounced that Google would operate as an<br> "AI first" company.<br>
                <br>
                Today's largest and most successful enterprises have used AI to improve their operations<br> and gain
                advantage
                on their competitors.<br>
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h1>What are the advantages and <br>disadvantages of artificial intelligence?</h1>
            <p>
                Artificial neural networks and deep learning artificial intelligence technologies are quickly<br>
                evolving,
                primarily because AI processes large amounts of data much faster and makes<br> predictions more
                accurately
                than
                humanly possible.<br>
                <br>
                While the huge volume of data being created on a daily basis would bury a human <br>researcher, AI
                applications
                that use machine learning can take that data and quickly turn it<br> into actionable information. As of
                this
                writing, the primary disadvantage of using AI is that it <br>is expensive to process the large amounts
                of
                data
                that AI programming requires.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Advantages :-</b><br>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Good at detail-oriented jobs;<br>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Reduced time for data-heavy tasks;<br>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Delivers consistent results; and<br>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> AI-powered virtual agents are always available.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Disadvantages :-</b><br>

                <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Expensive;<br>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Requires deep technical expertise;<br>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Limited supply of qualified workers to build AI tools;<br>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Only knows what it's been shown; and<br>
                <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Lack of ability to generalize from one task to another.<br><br>
            <h1>Strong AI vs. weak AI</h1>
            <p>AI can be categorized as either weak or strong.<br>
                Weak AI, also known as narrow AI, is an AI system that is designed and trained to<br> complete a
                specific
                task.
                Industrial robots and virtual personal assistants, <br>such as Apple's Siri, use weak AI.<br><br>
                Strong AI, also known as artificial general intelligence (AGI), describes programming that <br>can
                replicate
                the
                cognitive abilities of the human brain. When presented with an <br>unfamiliar task, a strong AI system
                can
                use
                fuzzy logic to apply knowledge from one <br>domain to another and find a solution autonomously. In
                theory, a
                strong AI program <br>should be able to pass both a Turing Test and the Chinese room test.<br>
