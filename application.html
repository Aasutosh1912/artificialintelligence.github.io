            <h1>What are the applications of AI?</h1><br>
            <p>
                Artificial intelligence has made its way into a wide variety of markets. Here are nine examples.<br><br>

                <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-dot"></i> AI in healthcare.<br><br> The biggest bets are on improving
                patient outcomes and reducing costs.
                <br>Companies are applying machine learning to make better and faster diagnoses than humans.<br> One of
                the best-known healthcare technologies is IBM Watson. It understands <br>natural language and can
                respond to questions asked of it. The system mines patient data <br>and other available data sources to
                form a hypothesis, which it then presents with a<br> confidence scoring schema. Other AI applications
                include using online virtual health<br> assistants and chatbots to help patients and healthcare
                customers find medical information, <br>schedule appointments, understand the billing process and
                complete other administrative<br> processes. An array of AI technologies is also being used to predict,
                fight and understand<br> pandemics such as COVID-19.<br><br><br>

                <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-dot"></i> AI in business.<br><br> Machine learning algorithms are being
                integrated into analytics and <br>customer
                relationship management (CRM) platforms to uncover information on how to better<br> serve customers.
                Chatbots have been incorporated into websites to provide immediate<br> service to customers. Automation
                of job positions has also become a talking point among <br>academics and IT analysts.<br><br><br>

                <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-dot"></i> AI in education.<br><br> AI can automate grading, giving
                educators more time. It can assess <br>students
                and adapt to their needs, helping them work at their own pace. AI tutors can provide <br>additional
                support to students, ensuring they stay on track. And it could change where and <br>how students learn,
                perhaps even replacing some teachers.<br><br><br>

                <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-dot"></i> AI in finance.<br><br> AI in personal finance applications,
                such as Intuit Mint or TurboTax, is
                <br>disrupting financial institutions. Applications such as these collect personal data and provide
                <br>financial advice. Other programs, such as IBM Watson, have been applied to the process of<br> buying
                a home. Today, artificial intelligence software performs much of the trading on Wall<br>
                Street.<br><br><br>
                <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-dot"></i> AI in law. <br><br>The discovery process -- sifting through
                documents -- in law is often overwhelming
                <br>for humans. Using AI to help automate the legal industry's labor-intensive processes is<br> saving
                time and improving client service. Law firms are using machine learning to describe<br> data and predict
                outcomes, computer vision to classify and extract information from<br> documents and natural language
                processing to interpret requests for information.<br><br><br>

                <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-dot"></i> AI in manufacturing.<br><br> Manufacturing has been at the
                forefront of incorporating robots into
                <br>the workflow. For example, the industrial robots that were at one time programmed to<br> perform
                single tasks and separated from human workers, increasingly function as cobots: <br>Smaller,
                multitasking robots that collaborate with humans and take on responsibility for more <br>parts of the
                job in warehouses, factory floors and other workspaces.<br><br><br>

                <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-dot"></i> AI in banking.<br><br> Banks are successfully employing
                chatbots to make their customers aware of<br>
                services and offerings and to handle transactions that don't require human intervention. AI <br>virtual
                assistants are being used to improve and cut the costs of compliance with banking <br>regulations.
                Banking organizations are also using AI to improve their decision-making for <br>loans, and to set
                credit limits and identify investment opportunities.<br><br><br>

                <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-dot"></i> AI in transportation.<br><br> In addition to AI's fundamental
                role in operating autonomous vehicles,<br>
                AI technologies are used in transportation to manage traffic, predict flight delays, and make<br> ocean
                shipping safer and more efficient.<br><br><br>

                <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-dot"></i> Security.<br><br> AI and machine learning are at the top of the
                buzzword list security vendors use
                <br>today to differentiate their offerings. Those terms also represent truly viable technologies.
                <br>Organizations use machine learning in security information and event management (SIEM) <br>software
                and related areas to detect anomalies and identify suspicious activities that indicate <br>threats. By
                analyzing data and using logic to identify similarities to known malicious code, AI <br>can provide
                alerts to new and emerging attacks much sooner than human employees and<br> previous technology
                iterations. The maturing technology is playing a big role in helping<br> organizations fight off cyber
                attacks.<br><br>
            </p>


            <h1>Augmented intelligence vs. artificial intelligence</h1><br>
            <p>Some industry experts believe the term artificial intelligence is too closely linked to popular<br>
                culture,
                and this has caused the general public to have improbable expectations about how<br> AI will change the
                workplace and life in general.<br><br>

                <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-dot"></i> Augmented intelligence. <br><br>Some researchers and marketers
                hope the label augmented<br>
                intelligence,
                which has a more neutral connotation, will help people understand that most <br>implementations of AI
                will
                be weak and simply improve products and services. Examples <br>include automatically surfacing important
                information in business intelligence reports or <br>highlighting important information in legal
                filings.<br><br><br>
                <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-dot"></i> Artificial intelligence. <br><br>True AI, or artificial general
                intelligence, is closely associated with
                <br>the concept of the technological singularity -- a future ruled by an artificial<br>
                superintelligence
                that far surpasses the human brain's ability to understand it or how it is<br> shaping our reality. This
                remains within the realm of science fiction, though some<br> developers are working on the problem. Many
                believe that technologies such as quantum <br>computing could play an important role in making AGI a
                reality
                and that we should <br>reserve the use of the term AI for this kind of general intelligence.<br><br><br>
