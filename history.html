            <h1>What is the history of AI?</h1><br><br>
            <p>
                The concept of inanimate objects endowed with intelligence has
                been around since ancient <br>times. The
                Greek god Hephaestus was depicted in myths as forging robot-like servants out <br>of gold. Engineers in
                ancient Egypt built statues of gods animated by priests. Throughout the <br>centuries, thinkers from
                Aristotle to the 13th century Spanish theologian Ramon Llull to Ren√©<br> Descartes and Thomas Bayes used
                the tools and logic of their times to describe human<br> thought processes as symbols, laying the
                foundation for AI concepts such as general <br>knowledge representation.<br><br>
                The late 19th and first half of the 20th centuries brought forth the foundational work that<br> would
                give rise to the modern computer. In 1836, Cambridge University mathematician<br> Charles Babbage and
                Augusta Ada Byron, Countess of Lovelace, invented the first design <br>for a programmable
                machine.<br><br><BR>

                <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-dot"></i> 1940s.<BR> <BR>Princeton mathematician John Von Neumann
                conceived
                the architecture for the<br> stored-program
                computer -- the idea that a computer's program and the data it processes <br>can be kept in the
                computer's memory. And Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts laid the <br>foundation for neural
                networks.<br><br><BR>

                <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-dot"></i> 1950s. <BR><BR>With the advent of modern computers, scientists
                could test their ideas about machine
                <br>intelligence. One method for determining whether a computer has intelligence was devised<br> by the
                British mathematician and World War II code-breaker Alan Turing. The Turing Test<br> focused on a
                computer's ability to fool interrogators into believing its responses to their <br>questions were made
                by a human being.<br><br><BR>

                <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-dot"></i> 1956.<BR> <BR>The modern field of artificial intelligence is
                widely
                cited as starting this year during a
                <br>summer conference at Dartmouth College. Sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research <br>Projects
                Agency (DARPA), the conference was attended by 10 luminaries in the field,<br> including AI pioneers
                Marvin Minsky, Oliver Selfridge and John McCarthy, who is credited<br> with coining the term artificial
                intelligence. Also in attendance were Allen Newell, a computer<br> scientist, and Herbert A. Simon, an
                economist, political scientist and cognitive psychologist,<br> who presented their groundbreaking Logic
                Theorist, a computer program capable of proving<br> certain mathematical theorems and referred to as the
                first AI program.<br><br><BR>

                <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-dot"></i> 1950s and 1960s. <BR><BR>In the wake of the Dartmouth College
                conference, leaders in the fledgling<br> field of
                AI predicted that a man-made intelligence equivalent to the human brain was around<br> the corner,
                attracting major government and industry support. Indeed, nearly 20 years of <br>well-funded basic
                research generated significant advances in AI: For example, in the late <br>1950s, Newell and Simon
                published the General Problem Solver (GPS) algorithm, which fell<br> short of solving complex problems
                but laid the foundations for developing more sophisticated<br> cognitive architectures; McCarthy
                developed Lisp, a language for AI programming that is still <br>used today. In the mid-1960s MIT
                Professor Joseph Weizenbaum developed ELIZA, an early<br> natural language processing program that laid
                the foundation for today's chatbots.<br><br><BR>

                <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-dot"></i> 1970s and 1980s.<BR><BR> But the achievement of artificial
                general
                intelligence proved elusive, not
                <br>imminent, hampered by limitations in computer processing and memory and by the <br>complexity of the
                problem. Government and corporations backed away from their support of<br> AI research, leading to a
                fallow period lasting from 1974 to 1980 and known as the first <br>"AI Winter." In the 1980s, research
                on deep learning techniques and industry's adoption of<br> Edward Feigenbaum's expert systems sparked a
                new wave of AI enthusiasm, only to be <br>followed by another collapse of government funding and
                industry support. The second AI<br> winter lasted until the mid-1990s.<br><br><BR>

                <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-dot"></i> 1990s through today.<BR> <BR>Increases in computational power
                and
                an explosion of data sparked <br>an AI
                renaissance in the late 1990s that has continued to present times. The latest focus on <br>AI has given
                rise to breakthroughs in natural language processing, computer vision, robotics,<br> machine learning,
                deep learning and more. Moreover, AI is becoming ever more tangible,<br> powering cars, diagnosing
                disease and cementing its role in popular culture. In 1997, IBM's <br>Deep Blue defeated Russian chess
                grandmaster Garry Kasparov, becoming the first<br> computer program to beat a world chess champion.
                Fourteen years later, IBM's Watson<br> captivated the public when it defeated two former champions on
                the game show Jeopardy!. <br>More recently, the historic defeat of 18-time World Go champion Lee Sedol
                by Google <br>DeepMind's AlphaGo stunned the Go community and marked a major milestone in the<br>
                development of intelligent machines.<br><br><BR>
